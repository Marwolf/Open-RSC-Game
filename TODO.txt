-------------------
-  Core Changes   -
-------------------

- remove event as a staff type ... re-evaluate existing events

- wilderness is always P2P ... configure to not cycle

- wilderness command box has incorrectly rendered % ... % isn't rendering as a newline at all

- remove teleport pools

- change captcha to a generator ... like WolfKingdomReborn

- Duke of Lumbridge should only have dialog option for anti dragon shield if the player does not have one in inventory.

- Change stat numbers in function calls to an enum for better readability.

- Quests still give exp at 100 fatigue. Player.increaseQuestXp ... Plague City quest completion seems to get it the closest to right.

- Bank note item ids should be 10k + original item id. Period.

- Remove all references to RSCU/RSCUnity/RSC Unity

- Merge in Marwolf's code

- World definitions that decide if the world is F2P or P2P. Need to implement disabling of P2P element if F2P world. Later on, create additional world types that have different rules like deathmatch anywhere (before wildy)

- Fix sound for client. jre9 doesn't include the audio player. Might be we need to package the library with the client.

- Update landscape from latest client.
